Check if _fbc exists. If it doesn't, create fbc using URL parameters.

## What is the main purpose of _fbc cookie?
When someone clicks on a Facebook Ad, the link URL may include a parameter: 'fbclid'.
Based on this, Facebook Pixel automatically creates the _fbc cookie for this lead.

**But... Therein lies the problem!**
If Facebook Pixel isn't properly installed or simply doesn't create it, you'll lose important data information for your data driven decisions, on your Facebook campaigns.
